# Screenshot Placeholder

To complete the documentation, please save the screenshot you shared as `dashboard-main.png` in this directory.

**Steps:**

1. Right-click on the screenshot image from your previous message
2. Select "Save Image As..." or "Save Image to Downloads"
3. Copy the downloaded image file to this `screenshots/` directory
4. Rename it to `dashboard-main.png`

This will make the screenshot display properly in the README.md file.

The README.md already references the screenshot with:

```markdown
![AWS Health Events Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard-main.png)
```

Once you place the image file here, it will display correctly in the documentation.
